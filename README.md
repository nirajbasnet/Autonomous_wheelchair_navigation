This project presents the use of probabilistic algorithms in a differential drive robot for totally autonomous navigation in indoor environment. The robot is capable of building map of its environment and global localization in the map thus built. The robot then performs path planning to compute an optimal path towards the goal location. The robot is equipped with inertial sensors - gyroscope and digital compass - and encoders for dead reckoning. We make use of LiDAR for mapping and localization, and a Microsoft Kinect is used in addition to detect obstacles not falling in the plane of LiDAR.
